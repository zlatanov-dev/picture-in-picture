Picture-in-Picture App

This is a small JavaScript application that allows users to display a selected media stream in picture-in-picture mode.
How to Use

    Open the index.html file in your web browser.
    Click on the "Select Media Stream" button to select the media stream you want to display in picture-in-picture mode.
    Click on the "Start Picture in Picture" button to activate picture-in-picture mode.
    To exit picture-in-picture mode, click on the picture-in-picture window or click the "Exit Picture in Picture" button in the video player controls.

How it Works

The application uses the navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia() method to select a media stream to display. The selected media stream is then passed to the videoElement and played.

The "Start Picture in Picture" button uses the videoElement.requestPictureInPicture() method to activate picture-in-picture mode. Once in picture-in-picture mode, the user can interact with the picture-in-picture window while the video continues to play.
Limitations

This application requires a web browser that supports the navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia() and videoElement.requestPictureInPicture() methods. Additionally, the user must grant permission to share their screen or a window before a media stream can be selected.
